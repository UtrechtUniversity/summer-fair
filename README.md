This software integrates existing data sets on transmission experiments by using semantic web technologies

Data sets on transmission experiments may vary in format, structure, syntax and semantics.
It is difficult to combine these heterogeneous data sets, for example, to do reanalysis and meta-analysis.
For this reason we developed an [ontology](/src/create_ontology/map_ontology/infection_trans.owl).
This shared vocabulary describes the main concepts and relations in the domain of transmission.
By mapping existing data sets to the concepts in the ontology, the data sets can be combined.
The mapped data sets are represented as linked data triples.
