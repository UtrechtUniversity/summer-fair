<p>Infection Transmission Ontology is developed by <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/wiki/SUMMERFAIR">SummerFair project</a> (SUMmarizing antiMicrobial transmission data to Enable data Reanalysis and predictions by FAIR data use).
The lack of a common terminology in the infection transmission experiments leads to repetition of costly experiments. By developing a domain ontology we can reuse and combine the transmission data, which leads to the improvement of an estimation of transmission parameters and prediction of outcomes of yet unobserved situations.</p>

<p>Infection Transmission Ontology is applicable to both livestock data from experiments and human data (observations) from hospitals.</p>
<p>Intially, the ontology was created based on animal experiments and reflects the design of the experiments. Usually hosts are randomly distributed over isolators/pens, where the number of hosts is selected to be challenged with bacteria strain with a specific gene. Inoculated animals are later introduced to susceptible animals. Cloacal or faecal samples are taken daily or once in 2 days to determine whether any of the susceptible animals became infected. To calculate the transmission rate, how fast the infected host can transmit the bacteria and to how many susceptible individuals, for every interval of time we need to know the number of new infected cases.</p>
<p> Examples with transmission data can be found in <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/tree/master/data/examples">Data repository</a> of SUMMER-Project.</p>
<p> Application of the ontology (caluculation of an estimation of transmission rate) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/wiki/SUMMERFAIR-Tutorial">Turorial</a>.</p>
