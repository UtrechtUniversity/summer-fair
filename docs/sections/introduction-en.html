Transmission Experiment Ontology is developed by <a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/wiki/SUMMERFAIR">SummerFair project</a> (SUMmarizing antiMicrobial transmission data to Enable data Reanalysis and predictions by FAIR data use). The lack of a common terminology in the AMR transmission experiments leads to repetition of costly experiments. By developing a domain ontology we can reuse and combine the AMR data, which leads to the improvement of an estimation of transmission parameters and prediction of outcomes of yet unobserved situations.</span>
